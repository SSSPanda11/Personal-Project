# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Setting up the project documentation and initial architecture planning.
- Creating the "Memory Bank" to establish a shared understanding of the project.

## Recent Changes
- Initial creation of `project-brief.md`.
- Initiating creation of full documentation suite: `progress.md`, `tasklist.md`, `techContext.md`, etc.

## Active Decisions
- **Architecture**: Proposed **Next.js** (App Router) for Frontend + API, hosted on Vercel/Netlify.
- **Styling**: Proposed **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive UI development.
- **Database**: **Google Sheets** (via API) as the primary data store for orders, as requested.
- **Payment Handling**: Manual verification for MFS (bKash/Nagad/Rocket) - User inputs Transaction ID.

## Next Steps
1. Validated Tech Stack with User (Pending confirmation on Next.js/Tailwind).
2. Initialize Project Repository.
3. specific implementation of the Google Sheets connection.
